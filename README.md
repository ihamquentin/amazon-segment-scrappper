description: 
in this personal project i worked on scrapping a segment of amazon that scrapes till the 4th  level of that segment.

after a list of the sections in that segmant is created the code iterates through each section collecting the section under them
and repeating this process until the 4th section of that segment 


later in the future this code would be improved to send the scrapped data into google cloud by using BigQuery.
